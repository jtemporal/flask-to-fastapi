# Migrating a Web Application from Flask to FastAPI: Avoiding Pitfalls

[This tutorial was made for EuroPython 2024](http://ep2024.europython.eu/session/migrating-a-web-application-from-flask-to-fastapi-avoiding-pitfalls).

This is a repo containing two web applications:
1. `flask-webapp`: Flask web application complete that will be used to migrate over to fastAPI;
1. `fastapi-webapi`: FastAPI starter application, this will be updated to work similarly to the Flask one.

Both applications count with an integration with [Auth0 by Okta, use this link to sign up](https://a0.to/plg_signup) and create your **free** account.

Note: They will run without the Auth0 setup but you'll be unable to login and follow the second half of the tutorial without it.

## Setup for the tutorial

You can either run this locally or on the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.

I recommend either connecting to the Codespace on VS Code on your machine using the [Codespaces VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) or run it locally to avoid problems with the auth integration.
